1/4 cup butter
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
 
1 tablespoon dried parsley
ground black pepper to taste
1/4 tablespoon dried basil
1 (16 ounce) package linguini pasta
Directions
Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Cook pasta according to package directions.
Combine clams with juice, butter, oil, minced garlic, parsley, basil, and pepper in a large saucepan. Place over medium heat until boiling. Serve warm over pasta.
